ðŸ““ ***__A PLACE FOR GENERATION USA (2023) STUDENTS TO COLLABORATE__*** ðŸ““

If you want to add something to the repository, please make a branch with your name (example: "<name>'sBranch") and work from there.
  Feel free to create new directories, files, add on to other's contributions, etc. . .
  REMEMBER, this is for practicing our Git and Github skills, as well as a place we can use for future individual/group project ideas.
